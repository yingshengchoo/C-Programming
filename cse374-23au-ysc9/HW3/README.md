# Program Description
This script performs a series of tests to the given executable and testfile for
basic functionality. Prints the results of these test to the given output file.

# Resources
For this script, I consulted resources provided from the cse374 webpage.

# Testfile functionality
Testfile1 tests for basic functionality of the testfile. Specifically, we expect
both input numbers to return a word within the dictionary and exits when expected
to. The second testfile tests to see if the program exits correctly. I.e. only
exits when the input is "exit" and not a string that contains exit.

# Potential Improvements
In addition to the existing tests, we could also tests to see if it can handle invalid
inputs. Ex. It handle invalid numbers or non-numerical values properly.
